    in java, then you will get an Overflow in the case of the maximum value or an Underflow in the case of the
    minimum.

//byte, short, long and width
  1.a Byte occupies 8 bit, we say that a byte has a width of 8
  2.a short can store a large range of numbers and occupies 16 bits, and has a width of 16
  3.an int, has a much larger range as we know, and occupies 32 bits, and has a width of 32
